#' Tribology data
#'
#' A dataset containing FTIR spectra of engine oils, and
#' HoG (histogram of gradients) feature vectors representing wear scar images
#' after an SRV experiment.

#' @format
#' A list containing the following components:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{FTIR}{a numeric matrix (214 * 1668) containing FTIR spectra}
#'   \item{HOG}{a numeric matrix (214 * 1764) containing HoG features}
